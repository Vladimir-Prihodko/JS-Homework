=============================== Launching App ===============================

Nothing special is required to start the app as no libraries or frameworks were used so far. 

Create a new folder on your computer where you will download files from the repository. Go to that folder through the terminal. As soon as you are in the folder 
where you are going to download the files, type in following: 

git clone https://github.com/Vladimir-Prihodko/JS-Homework 

Once you get files downloaded in the folder, find in folder JS-Homework file index.html 

Open that file in your browser. Both stylesheet and Javascript files are linked to the index.html file. 

Everything is set and ready to roll!
